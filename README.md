# NetworkX--Flight-Network-Resilience-using-RAG
We model flight networks as graphs to pinpoint critical vulnerabilities and quantify resilience, then expose these insights through a RAG-powered natural-language interface.

# Flight Network Resilience Dashboard

An interactive dashboard to explore the resilience of global flight networks using graph‐theoretic methods and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) interface for natural-language queries.

---

## Features

- **Network Visualization**  
  Plot the full undirected graph of airports (nodes) and direct flights (edges).

- **Centrality Analysis**  
  Compute and display top-5 airports by degree and betweenness centrality.

- **Disruption Simulation**  
  Compare how the largest connected component (LCC) degrades under:  
  - Random failures  
  - Targeted attacks on high-centrality nodes

- **Shortest-Path Examples**  
  Show how rerouting changes when a hub (e.g. ATL) is removed.

- **Extended Risk Analyses**  
  - Cancellation Risk (β-distributed edge `cancel_rate`)  
  - Delay-Weighted Path (normal-distributed edge `avg_delay`)  
  - Synthetic Weather-Risk Ranking (β-distributed per-node scores)

- **RAG Q&A Interface**  
  Ask questions in plain English—e.g.  
  > “Which airport removal fragments the network most?”  
  Answers are generated by retrieving key analytics and passing them to an LLM.

### **4. Future Enhancements**
- **Real‐World Weather & Delay Data**  
  Integrate historical meteorological and flight-delay datasets (e.g., NOAA, Bureau of Transportation Statistics) to replace synthetic risk scores with empirical measures.

- **Weighted & Directed Graph Support**  
  Model edge weights by flight frequency, passenger volume or capacity, and support directed edges for origin-destination asymmetry.

- **Temporal Analysis & Animation**  
  Enable time-sliced resilience (peak/off-peak, seasonality) and animate graph evolution under rolling disruptions.

- **Geospatial Map Visualization**  
  Overlay nodes and edges on an interactive world map (e.g., via PyDeck or Folium) to contextualize vulnerabilities geographically.

- **User Authentication & Profiles**  
  Add login with OAuth/GitHub to save custom scenarios, bookmarks and export personalized reports.
